# Franklin API
FranklinAPI is the official graphql endpoint for writell clients.

What are the available functions? You can find them [here](API.md)

### Is franklin federated? or decentralized?
Although it's not part of our roadmap to make it decentralized, you certainly can run your own instance of `franklin-api`.
